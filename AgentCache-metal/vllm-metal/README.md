# vLLM Metal Plugin

> **High-performance LLM inference on Apple Silicon using MLX and vLLM**

vLLM Metal is a plugin that enables vLLM to run on Apple Silicon Macs using MLX as the primary compute backend. It unifies MLX and PyTorch under a single lowering path.

## Requirements

- macOS on Apple Silicon
- Native arm64 Python 3.12. Rosetta/x86_64 Python is not supported.

## Supported Models

vllm-metal supports a growing set of text-only language models on Apple Silicon. See the full matrix in [docs/supported_models.md](docs/supported_models.md).

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/main/install.sh | bash
```

Using the install script above, the following will be installed under the `~/.venv-vllm-metal` directory (the default).
- vllm-metal plugin
- vllm core
- Related libraries

If you run `source ~/.venv-vllm-metal/bin/activate`, the `vllm` CLI becomes available and you can access the vLLM right away.

For how to use the `vllm` CLI, please refer to the official vLLM guide.
https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/cli/

### Optional: Rust frontend (experimental)

Pass `--with-vllm-rs` to also install [`vllm-frontend-rs`](https://github.com/Inferact/vllm-frontend-rs), an experimental Rust drop-in for vLLM's serving layer. Requires the Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs):

```bash
./install.sh --with-vllm-rs
```

See [docs/rust_frontend.md](docs/rust_frontend.md) for usage and architecture.
